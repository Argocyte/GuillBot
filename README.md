# GuillBot
Realm of the mad god discord bot pulling information from RealmEye.

To start using it, you must add a discord account token to GuillBot\GuillBot\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0\Resources\config.json
The default command prefix (e.g !Help) is !, this can also be changed in the config.json file.

To make a bot account token, go here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications

This bot uses RealmEyeSharp, a repository which I contributed to during the development of this bot. I couldn't have made it without the invaluable contribution of TheNorthJyde from his initial repository.
